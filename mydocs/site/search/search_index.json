This application queries selected websites to discover new web postings, and I only save the most captivating bookmarks for future reference.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I\u2019ve worked in diverse technological fields, including consulting, management, engineering, and individual contributions. My expertise spans hardware and software development, project management, and project rescue. Additionally, I analyze and monitor performance of hardware, networks, software, and web technologies.</p>"},{"location":"ElectronicComponents/","title":"Electronic Components","text":"<p>This journey commenced when I received an Allied Electronics catalog.</p> <p>I was familiar with some components and intrigued by those that were unfamiliar to me. The descriptions provided insights into further learning about them.</p> <p>I subscribed to several weekly and monthly electronic periodicals that significantly enhanced my knowledge and broadened my perspective. They frequently featured new components and electronic equipment, accompanied by concise descriptions and synopsis articles that outline their applications.</p> <p>Other sources of information about components and electronic equipment were local and  technical book stores in other cities.</p> <p>I consistently added books to my technical library, finding new books of interest was a delightful experience. However, I also observed that some newly published books were already outdated.</p> <p>Over time, the advent of the Internet and Artificial Intelligence has significantly enhanced my comprehension of various technologies. The era of manually assembling and parsing information from diverse sources has largely been supplanted by these advancements.</p> <p>Utilizing an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) Internet application daily enables track technologies of interest.</p>"},{"location":"Radio/","title":"Radio Journeys","text":"<p>My radio journey commenced with the family Zenith radio. It was a multiband radio that included some amateur radio and foreign broadcast bands. I particularly enjoyed listening to Voice of America, South American, Australian, and others stations. Listening to amateur radio bands also piqued my interest.</p>"},{"location":"Radio/#amater-radio","title":"Amater Radio","text":"<p>The subsequent journey involved acquiring knowledge about radios and transmitters. The city library provided books on the subject, which I thoroughly enjoyed and continued to study radios and transmitters in subsequent journeys.I particularly enjoyed constructing a crystal radio receiver that did not require an external power source, operating solely on the energy received from radio waves through an antenna. It could receive AM (amplitude modulated) signals from local stations.</p> <p>The next journey was studying and taking the Federal Communications Commission tests for my novice and general amateur radio licenses. Both tests required receiving and transmitting Morse Code at slow and medium speeds. My Morse code listening skills were honed by receiving Morse code using a multiband radio.</p> <p>I practiced Morse code sending skills after constructing a transistor audio oscillator using an early transistor. A Morse code key could turn it on or off, and my Morse code sending skills improved significantly.</p>"},{"location":"Radio/#commercial-license","title":"Commercial License","text":"<p>My next journey was studing for and taking the Federal Communications Commission test for a First Class Commercial license required for those responsible for operating and maintaining broadcast transmitters, especially as a chief engineer at a broadcast station or for work on television transmitters.</p>"},{"location":"TechEducation/","title":"Tech Education","text":""},{"location":"TechEducation/#junior-college","title":"Junior College","text":"<p>My academic journey in electronic engineering commenced during my enrollment at a technology junior college.</p> <p>During my studies, I continued a keen interest in electronic components and the utilization of electronic instruments, particularly oscilloscopes.</p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed electronic circuits, components, vacuum tubes and transistors classes. Laboratories involved constructing circuits and measuring various electronic parameters.</p>"},{"location":"TechEducation/#engineering-college","title":"Engineering College","text":"<p>My subsequent academic pursuit in electronic engineering entailed enrolling in a four-year Electronics Engineering Bachelor Degree program.</p> <p>In parallel with Electronic Engineering classes, mathematics and physics classes were aligned with Electronic Engineering theory classes</p>"},{"location":"TechEducation/#circuit-analysis-software","title":"Circuit Analysis Software","text":"<p>An intriguing aspect of one class was to describe a circuit to an electronic circuit analysis software program that analyzed circuits and printed out computed parameters. The results of the circuit I described were a significant revelation for me.</p>"},{"location":"TechEducation/#circuit-parasitics","title":"Circuit Parasitics","text":"<p>The success of physical circuit design is influenced by the physical reality of component tolerances, and parasitics like electromagnetic interference generated by electronic component that unintentionally affecting the operation of another component or circuits. This can happen through radiation radio waves through air or conduction through wires or circut traces. These effects are usually difficult to measure and correct.</p>"},{"location":"TechEducation/#software","title":"Software","text":"<p>I was drawn to software Engineering because of the difficlties  correcting hardware parasitics. Support software, hardware or network errors can usually be traced and corrected.</p>"},{"location":"TechEducation/#senior-project","title":"Senior Project","text":"<p>The final year of Electronic Engineering classes included designing, developing, and documenting a Senior Project before graduation.</p> <p>I developed a software program after learning some aspects of the Fortran programming language. The progrm utilized the Fourier transform, a mathematical technique that converts a repetitive waveform from the time domain to the frequency domain. This process reveals the frequencies present in a repetitive waveform and their respective amplitudes. The software underwent laboratory testing using a waveform generator and a spectrum analyzer instrument. The spectrum analyzer visualizes and measures electronic signals based on their frequency content. A perfect software square wave analyzed by the software output was in agreement with the spectrum analyzer\u2019s results. A practical application of the software is to calibrate an oscilloscope time axis by adjusting a waveform generator to produce a perfect square wave viewed on a spectrum analyzer and adjusting the oscilloscope time axis to observe the perfect square wave.</p>"}]}
