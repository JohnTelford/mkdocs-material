This application queries selected websites to discover new web postings, and I only save the most captivating bookmarks for future reference.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I\u2019ve worked in diverse technological fields, including consulting, management, engineering, and individual contributions. My expertise spans hardware and software development, project management, and project rescue. Additionally, I analyze and monitor performance of hardware, networks, software, and web technologies.</p>"},{"location":"Radio/","title":"Radio Journeys","text":"<p>My radio journey commenced with the family Zenith radio. It was a multiband radio that included some amateur radio and foreign broadcast bands. I particularly enjoyed listening to Voice of America, South American, Australian, and others stations. Listening to amateur radio bands also piqued my interest.</p>"},{"location":"Radio/#amater-radio","title":"Amater Radio","text":"<p>The subsequent journey involved acquiring knowledge about radios and transmitters. The city library provided books on the subject, which I thoroughly enjoyed and continued to study radios and transmitters in subsequent journeys.I particularly enjoyed constructing a crystal radio receiver that did not require an external power source, operating solely on the energy received from radio waves through an antenna. It could receive AM (amplitude modulated) signals from local stations.</p> <p>The next journey was studying and taking the Federal Communications Commission tests for my novice and general amateur radio licenses. Both tests required receiving and transmitting Morse Code at slow and medium speeds. My Morse code listening skills were honed by receiving Morse code using a multiband radio.</p> <p>I practiced Morse code sending skills after constructing a transistor audio oscillator using an early transistor. A Morse code key could turn it on or off, and my Morse code sending skills improved significantly.</p>"},{"location":"Radio/#commercial-license","title":"Commercial License","text":"<p>My next journey was studing for and taking the Federal Communications Commission test for a First Class Commercial license required for those responsible for operating and maintaining broadcast transmitters, especially as a chief engineer at a broadcast station or for work on television transmitters.</p>"}]}
