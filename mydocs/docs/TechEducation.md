# Tech Education

## Junior College


My academic journey in electronic engineering commenced during my enrollment at a technology junior college.

During my studies, I continued a keen interest in electronic components and the utilization of electronic instruments, particularly oscilloscopes.

I thoroughly enjoyed electronic circuits, components, vacuum tubes and transistors classes. Laboratories involved constructing circuits and measuring various electronic parameters.

## Engineering College

My subsequent academic pursuit in electronic engineering entailed enrolling in a four-year Electronics Engineering Bachelor Degree program.

### Math and Science

In parallel with Electronic Engineering classes, mathematics and physics classes were aligned with Electronic Engineering theory classes

### Circuit Analysis Software

An intriguing aspect of one class was to describe a circuit to an electronic circuit analysis software program that analyzed circuits and printed out computed parameters. The results of the circuit I described were a significant revelation for me.

### Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)

The success of physical circuit design is influenced by the physical reality of component tolerances and EMI generated by component or circuits unintentionally affecting the operation of other components or circuits. EMI is usually difficult to measure and mitigate.

### Software

Software engineering is eaiser to mitigate errors being more traceable and fixable compared to hardware EMI.

### Senior Project

The final year of Electronic Engineering classes included designing, developing, and documenting a Senior Project before graduation.

I developed a Fortran program using Fourier transforms to analyze waveforms, with verification using lab instruments, and oscilloscope calibration.
