### Microcode



Microcode is a low-level code within a CPU that defines how the processor implements its instruction set and controls its behavior

microcode is essential for modern CPU design, serving as a microprogrammed control layer that interprets machine instructions and controls internal CPU operations dynamically

Microcode acts as an abstraction layer between the machine code instructions a programmer writes and the underlying hardware signals

Microcode is a specialized type of firmware embedded within the CPU itself. It provides low-level instructions that translate complex machine instructions into simpler, more fundamental operations that control the CPU’s internal circuits. Essentially, microcode acts as an intermediary, converting higher-level CPU instructions into detailed control signals that direct hardware behavior. It is stored in a special control memory inside the processor
