# Electronic Components

This journey commenced when I received an Allied Electronics catalog.

I was familiar with some components and intrigued by those that were unfamiliar to me. The descriptions provided insights into further learning about them.

I subscribed to several weekly and monthly electronic periodicals that significantly enhanced my knowledge and broadened my perspective. They frequently featured new components and electronic equipment, accompanied by concise descriptions and synopsis articles that outline their applications.

Other sources of information about components and electronic equipment were local and  technical book stores in other cities.

I consistently added books to my technical library, finding new books of interest was a delightful experience. However, I also observed that some newly published books were already outdated.

Over time, the advent of the Internet and Artificial Intelligence has significantly enhanced my comprehension of various technologies. The era of manually assembling and parsing information from diverse sources has largely been supplanted by these advancements.

Utilizing an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) Internet application daily enables track technologies of interest.
