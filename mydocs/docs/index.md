# Technology Journeys

This website chronicles my journeys exploring various technologies.

As a lifelong technology enthusiast, I start my day by using an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) computer application. This application queries selected websites to discover new web postings, and I only save the most captivating bookmarks for future reference.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in diverse technological fields, including consulting, management, engineering, and individual contributions. My expertise spans hardware and software development, project management, and project rescue. Additionally, I analyze and monitor performance of hardware, networks, software, and web technologies.
