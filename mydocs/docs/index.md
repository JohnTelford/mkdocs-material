# Technology Journeys

This website is a memoir of my Technology journeys. 

As a lifelong technology enthusiast, I begin my day by using an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) computer application. This application queries selected websites to discover new web postings, and I only save the most intriguing bookmarks for future reference.

Throughout my career, I’ve ventured into various fields of technology, including consulting, management, engineering,  individual contributions, hardware, software development, project management, and project rescue. My responsibilities have encompassed analyzing and monitoring the performance of hardware, networks, software, and web technologies.
