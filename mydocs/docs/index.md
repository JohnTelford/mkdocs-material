# Technology Journeys

This website compiles my experiences exploring various technologies.

As a lifelong technology enthusiast, I begin my day by using an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) computer application. This application queries selected websites to discover new web postings, and I only save the most intriguing bookmarks for future reference.

Throughout my career, I’ve worked in diverse technological fields, including consulting, management, engineering, and individual contributions. My expertise encompasses hardware and software development, project management, and project rescue. Additionally, I analyze and monitor the performance of hardware, networks, software, and web technologies.
