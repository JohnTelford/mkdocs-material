# Radio Journeys

My radio journey commenced with the family multiband radio that included some amateur radio and foreign broadcast bands. I particularly enjoyed listening to Voice of America, South American, Australian, and others stations. Listening to amateur radio bands also piqued my interest.

## Amater Radio

Learning about basic radios. transmitters, and atennas at the city library, and building a crystal radio able to receive local AM signals without external power.

## Licensing

Studying and passing FCC tests for novice and general amateur radio licenses, with a focus on Morse Code practicing reception and transmission using a homemade transistor audio oscillator and Morse key.

## Commercial License

My next journey was studing for and taking the Federal Communications Commission test for a First Class Commercial license required for those responsible for operating and maintaining broadcast transmitters, especially as a chief engineer at a broadcast station or for work on television transmitters.
